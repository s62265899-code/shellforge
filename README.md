## Lexical Analysis and Tokenization

1. **Tokenization & Data Structures (`token.h` / `token.c`)**:
   - Standardized `token_type_t` enumeration (`TOKEN_WORD`, `TOKEN_PIPE`, `TOKEN_INPUT`, `TOKEN_OUTPUT`, `TOKEN_APPEND`, `TOKEN_BACKGROUND`, `TOKEN_END`).
   - Dynamic token list container (`token_list_t`) with bounds safety.
   - Formatted token printing matching exact assignment requirements (`0 : WORD ls`).

2. **Lexical Analysis (`lexer.h` / `lexer.c`)**:
   - Character scanner processing input into structured tokens.
   - Support for single quotes and double quotes, preserving internal spaces.
   - Support for escape characters (`\`).
   - Operator recognition (`|`, `<`, `>`, `>>`, `&`).
   - Graceful error reporting for unterminated quotes (`Lexer Error : Unterminated ... quote`).

3. **Shell REPL & History (`main.c` / `history.c`)**:
   - GNU Readline integration for prompt input (`shellforge$ `).
   - Welcome banner display.
   - History logging (`add_history` and custom `history` command).
   - Built-in `exit` command handling.

## Parsing and Variable Expansion

1. **Parser (`parser.h` / `parser.c`)**:
   - Converts the token stream into a structured pipeline (`command_t` / `pipeline_t`) of up to 16 commands with up to 128 arguments each.
   - Captures input/output redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`) and background execution (`&`).
   - Formatted pipeline printing matching exact assignment requirements (`Command 1`, `argv[0] = ls`, aligned `Input` / `Output` / `Append` / `Background` fields).
   - Graceful error reporting for missing redirection filenames and over-long pipelines (`Parser Error : ...`).

2. **Variable Expansion (`expand.h` / `expand.c`)**:
   - Expands environment variables in command arguments after parsing (`$NAME` and `${NAME}`) via `getenv()`.
   - Unset variables expand to the empty string.

3. **REPL Integration (`main.c`)**:
   - Full lex → token print → parse → expand → pipeline print flow on every command.
   - Exact banner and token/pipeline output formats.
   - Ctrl+D exits with `Goodbye!`; built-in `exit` prints `Exiting...`; `history` builtin retained.

## Built-in Command Handling

1. **Built-in Commands (`builtin.h` / `builtin.c`)**:
   - Built-in commands `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and `exit` executed by the shell process itself, without `fork()`.
   - `cd` changes the current working directory, defaulting to `HOME` when no argument is given, with graceful error reporting for invalid directories.
   - `pwd` prints the current working directory via `getcwd()`.
   - `echo` prints its arguments joined by single spaces.
   - `exit` terminates the shell through a return code to the main loop, without printing `Exiting...`.

2. **REPL Integration (`main.c`)**:
   - Built-in dispatch runs after the token and pipeline report, only for single-command pipelines (`command_count == 1`).
   - Removed the old `strcmp(line, "exit")` handling; `exit` is now a proper built-in.
   - `history` built-in retained.

## Command Execution and Process Management

1. **External Command Execution (`executor.h` / `executor.c`)**:
   - External commands executed via `fork()` + `execvp()` + `waitpid()`.
   - The child process replaces its image with `execvp()`; on failure it reports the error with `perror()` and exits with `exit(1)`.
   - The parent process waits for the child with `waitpid()` and collects its exit status.
   - `fork()` failure is reported with `perror()`.

2. **REPL Integration (`main.c`)**:
   - Built-in commands are still handled in-process; only non-built-in commands go through `fork()`/`execvp()`.
   - External execution runs after the token and pipeline report, only for single-command input (`command_count == 1`).

## Process Creation and Background Execution

1. **Process Creation (`executor.h` / `executor.c`)**:
   - One `fork()`ed child process per command in the pipeline.
   - Each child replaces its image with `execvp()`; on failure it reports the error with `perror()` and exits with `exit(1)`.
   - The parent waits for each foreground child with `waitpid()` and collects its exit status.
   - `fork()` failure is reported with `perror()`.

2. **Background Execution (`&`)**:
   - When a command or pipeline ends with `&`, the parent does not wait for the children.
   - For single background commands, the child PID is reported via `[Background PID: <pid>]`.
   - For background pipelines, the PID of the first process is reported via `[Background PID: <pid>]`.
   - In background processes without explicit input redirection, `stdin` is redirected from `/dev/null` using `open()` and `dup2()` to prevent accidental terminal reads.
   - Finished background children are reaped asynchronously via a `SIGCHLD` signal handler installed with `sigaction()`, using non-blocking `waitpid(-1, NULL, WNOHANG)` to prevent zombie accumulation.
   - Signals are safely blocked around foreground wait sequences to protect synchronous waiting.

3. **System calls used**:
   - `fork`, `execvp`, `waitpid`, `sigaction`, `sigprocmask`, `open`, `dup2`, `close`, `exit`.

## Pipeline Execution and I/O Redirection

1. **Pipes (`executor.h` / `executor.c`)**:
   - Consecutive commands are connected with `pipe()`; each child wires its `stdin`/`stdout` with `dup2()` and then closes all pipe file descriptors.
   - The parent closes its pipe ends so EOF propagates correctly, and collects every child with `waitpid()`.
   - `pipe()` failures are reported with `perror()`.

2. **I/O Redirection**:
   - `<` opens the input file with `open(path, O_RDONLY)`.
   - `>` opens the output file with `open(path, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644)`.
   - `>>` opens the output file with `open(path, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND, 0644)`.
   - Redirections are applied with `dup2()` in the child after pipe wiring, so explicit redirection overrides pipe ends.
   - `open()` failure is reported with `perror()` and the child exits with `exit(1)`.

3. **System calls used**:
   - `pipe`, `dup2`, `open`, `close`.

## Build and Run

To compile the shell:
```bash
make
```

To run the shell:
```bash
./shellforge
# or
make run
```

To clean build artifacts:
```bash
make clean
```

To run the end-to-end test suite:
```bash
make test
# or
bash tests/run_tests.sh
```
The suite covers external execution, redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`), pipelines, background execution (`&`), built-in commands, and the exec-error path."# shellforge"
